This folder contains some accessories that access the arduino yun through the REST services. To use them with the Hap-node, download git 
repository and copy the samples to the accessories folder located under the HAP-node directory of your system.

 For instance in OSMC:
 * cp *Luz_Fondo_accessory.js /home/osmc/HAP-NodeJS/accessories
